<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to update virus definitions on an internal ClamAV mirror that has been deployed by the ClamAV Mirror for PCF tile. It also explains how these updated virus definitions propagate to all BOSH-managed VMs that are running ClamAV.

The ClamAV Mirror for PCF tile and the ClamAV Add-on for PCF tile work together as follows:

  - The add-on tile runs ClamAV on all BOSH VMs, by adding it to the BOSH runtime config.
  - The mirror tile creates an internal mirror that is used by the ClamAV components running on BOSH VMs.

ClamAV jobs use three virus definitions files, `main.cvd`, `daily.cvd`, and `bytecode.cvd`.
The ClamAV mirror deployment serves these three files to all ClamAV jobs in your environment.

To update the virus definitions, complete the following procedure:

1. Download the three virus definition files from the ClamAV virus
database mirror or an equivalent mirror.
To download the virus definitions from the official mirror, use the following URLs:
    * http://database.clamav.net/main.cvd
    * http://database.clamav.net/daily.cvd
    * http://database.clamav.net/bytecode.cvd

1. Copy your downloaded virus definition files to your Ops Manager VM.

    ```
    scp -i PATH-TO-PRIVATE-KEY PATH-TO-CVD-FILE ... ubuntu@OPS-MANAGER-VM-IP:
    ```

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">$ scp -i ~/.ssh/my-key.pem ~/Downloads/main.cvd ~/Downloads/daily.cvd ~/Downloads/bytecode.cvd ubuntu<span>@</span>192.168.0.2: </pre>

1. SSH into the Ops Manager VM.
   For instructions, see [SSH into Ops Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#ssh).

1. Find the name of your ClamAV mirror deployment by running the following command:

    ```
    bosh -e BOSH-ENVIRONMENT deployments | grep p-clamav-mirror | cut -f1
    ```

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e my-env deployments | grep p-clamav-mirror | cut -f1</pre>

    The deployment name starts with `p-clamav-mirror-` and is followed by a string of characters.

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">$ p-clamav-mirror-08815ca5ead252c4b8d8</pre>


1. Copy the virus definitions to your ClamAV mirror deployment by running the following command:

    ```
    bosh -e BOSH-ENVIRONMENT -d CLAMAV-DEPLOYMENT-NAME scp /path/to/local/main.cvd /path/to/local/daily.cvd /path/to/local/bytecode.cvd :/var/vcap/data/clamav-mirror/unvalidated
    ```

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e my-env -d p-clamav-mirror-4cb8cfbeee717258d72e scp main.cvd daily.cvd bytecode.cvd :/var/vcap/data/clamav-mirror/unvalidated</pre>

1. Verify that the mirror validated and updated its local copies of the virus
    definitions by running the following command:

    ```
    bosh -e BOSH-ENVIRONMENT -d CLAMAV-DEPLOYMENT-NAME ssh -c "sudo cat FILE | grep \"updated /var/vcap/store\""
    ```

    Where `FILE` is determined by the output destination configured in
    [Configure ClamAV Mirror for PCF](./install-mirror.html#configure-mirror).
    * `/var/vcap/sys/log/clamav-mirror/clamav-mirror.stdout.log` for stdout
    * `/var/vcap/sys/log/clamav-mirror/clamav-mirror.stderr.log` for stderr
    * `/var/log/syslog` for syslog

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ bosh -e my-env -d p-clamav-mirror-4cb8cfbeee717258d72e ssh -c "sudo cat /var/log/messages | grep \"updated /var/vcap/store\""

    2019/05/30 17:16:34 updated /var/vcap/store/clamav-mirror/validated/bytecode.cvd
    2019/05/30 17:16:40 updated /var/vcap/store/clamav-mirror/validated/daily.cvd
    2019/05/30 17:16:49 updated /var/vcap/store/clamav-mirror/validated/main.cvd
    </pre>
