<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to install and configure ClamAV Mirror for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

Pivotal recommends that you use this mirror when you use <%= vars.product_short %>.
If you already have a mirror deployed that you want to use, you can use that instead.
However, if you have an air-gapped environment you must install the ClamAV Mirror for PCF tile
to use <%= vars.product_short %>.


<p class="note"><strong>Note: </strong> This is optional if your environment is not air-gapped.</p>

##<a id="prereqs"></a>Prerequisites

To install ClamAV Add-on, you must have the following:

* **A PCF operator with admin rights**.
For more information, see [Operators](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/user-types.html#operator).

* **PCF Operations Manager (Ops Manager)**.
For compatible versions, see the [Product Snapshot](./index.html#snapshot).

* **At least 1&nbsp;GB of memory free on each VM**.
ClamAV Add-on uses 610&nbsp;MB of memory.

## <a id='install-mirror'></a> Install ClamAV Mirror for PCF

If you do not have an external mirror for ClamAV jobs to fetch database updates from,
you can deploy one using the ClamAV Mirror for PCF.
This deployed mirror can support air-gapped environments.

To install the ClamAV for PCF Mirror for PCF tile, do the following:

1. Download the product file from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-clamav-addon).

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and select **Import a Product** to upload the product file.

1. Under the **Import a Product** button, click **+** next to the version number of ClamAV Mirror for PCF.
This adds the tile to your staging area.

1. Click the newly added **ClamAV Mirror for PCF** tile.

## <a id='azs'></a> Assign AZs and Networks

To assign AZs and networks, do the following:

1. Click the **Assign AZs and Networks** settings tab.

1. Configure the fields as follows:

    <table class="nice">
      <th>Field</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Place singleton jobs in</strong></td>
        <td>Select the AZ that you want the <code>clamav_mirror</code> VM to run in.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Balance other jobs in</strong></td>
        <td>Select the same AZ as above.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Network</strong></td>
        <td>Select a subnet for the <code>clamav_mirror</code> VM. <br>This is typically the same subnet that
          includes the Pivotal Application Services (PAS) component VMs.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='configure-mirror'></a> Configure ClamAV Mirror for PCF
To configure ClamAV Mirror for PCF, do the following:

1. Click **ClamAV Mirror Configuration**.

1. Configure the output destination of the logs from the ClamAV mirror job
to one of the following supported options:
  * **stdout**: sends messages to `/var/vcap/sys/log/clamav-mirror/clamav-mirror.stdout.log`
  * **stderr**: sends messages to `/var/vcap/sys/log/clamav-mirror/clamav-mirror.stderr.log`
  * **syslog**: sends messages to `/var/log/messages`

1. The ClamAV Mirror for PCF will serve virus definitions to your environment for the ClamAV Add-on for PCF to use, but the ClamAV Mirror needs to get databases itself.
You can configure the ClamAV Mirror to get virus definitions from one of the following supported options:
<%# TODO Dylan: less verbose things with tile field updates %>
  * **Manual updates**: Suited for air-gapped environments, or if you want to control the database versions available to your environment
  * **Use the ClamAV official mirror**: The mirror fetches databases from database.clamav.net
  * **I have my own mirror**: Enables you to enter a list of hostnames or IPs of mirrors

## <a id='proxy'></a> (Optional) Configure HTTP Proxy for ClamAV Mirror Jobs

If you selected **Use the ClamAV official mirror** or **I have my own mirror** in the previous section, you can configure a proxy for the ClamAV Mirror to retrieve the databases from.
To do this, click **HTTP Proxy Configuration for ClamAV Mirror Jobs** and set
**HTTP proxy for ClamAV jobs to get database updates** to `Enabled`.
Then enter the `host`, `port`, `username` and `password` in the fields that appear.

##<a id="syslog"></a> Configure System Logging
Follow the steps below to enable system logging for ClamAV Mirror.
Logs use RFC5424 format.

1. Click **Syslog**.
1. Click **Yes**.
1. Configure the fields as follows:
  <table>
    <tr><th>Field</th><th>Instructions</th></tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Address</strong></td>
        <td>Enter the address or host of the syslog server for sending logs, for example,
            <code>logmanager.example.com</code>.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Port</strong></td>
        <td>Enter the port of the syslog server for sending logs, for example, <code>29279</code>.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Transport Protocol</strong></td>
        <td>Select the protocol over which you want system logs. Pivotal recommends using TCP.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Enable TLS</strong></td>
    <td>If you select TCP, you can also select to send logs encrypted over TLS.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Permitted Peer</strong></td>
        <td>Enter either the accepted fingerprint, in SHA1, or the name of the remote peer, for example, <code>*.example.com</code></td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>SSL Certificate</strong></td>
        <td>Enter the SSL Certificate(s) for the syslog server. This ensures the logs are transported securely.</td></tr>
  </table>
  <p class="note"><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: If your syslog server is external to PCF, you might need to select
            <strong>Provide public IP addresses to all Service VMs</strong> on the <strong>Settings</strong> page.<p>

1. Click **Save**.

## <a id="apply-changes-mirror"></a> Apply Changes from Your Configuration

You can scale up the number of deployed mirrors by clicking **Resource Config**
and setting the number of `clamav-mirror` instances to the number of mirrors that
you want to deploy.
The ClamAV jobs do load balancing for you,
<%# TODO Dylan: confirm next line %>
but you need to **Apply Changes** for the ClamAV jobs to detect the number of mirrors.

Your ClamAV Mirror installation is not complete until you apply your configuration changes.
To do this, follow the procedure below:

1. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.
1. Unselect all products except `BOSH Director` and `ClamAV Mirror for PCF` and click **Apply Changes**.
1. After **Apply Changes** is complete, if you selected `Manual updates(I will ssh stuff myself)`, upload a set of virus definitions
to your deployed `clamav-mirrors`.
To do this, see [Updating Virus Definitions on Deployed ClamAV Mirrors](./updating-databases.html).
