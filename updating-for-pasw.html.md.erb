<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to update your runtime config to add the new windows1803 stemcell. 

If you are upgrading to PAS for Windows v2.3, you must add the windows1803 stemcell to your runtime config
before upgrading to PAS for Windows v2.3. 

<p class="note warning"><strong> WARNING</strong>: If you upgrade to PAS for Windows v2.3 without first updating runtime config, 
then the PAS for Windows VMs will not be protected by ClamAV.</p>

##<a id="add"></a> Add the windows1803 Stemcell Property to the ClamAV Add-on

To add the `windows1803` stemcell property to the runtime config, do the following:

1. SSH into the Ops Manager VM.
   For how to do this, see [SSH into Ops Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#ssh).

2. To retrieve and save the ClamAV add-on runtime config, run the following command:

    ```
    bosh -e BOSH-ENVIRONMENT runtime-config –name clamav > /tmp/clamav.yml
    ```

    Where `BOSH-ENVIRONMENT` is the alias you set for the BOSH Director.

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">$ bosh2 -e my-env runtime-config –name clamav > /tmp/clamav.yml </pre> 


3. Edit the `clamav.yml` file to add `- os: windows1803` under 
    `stemcell` as shown below:

    ```
    addons:
    - name: clamav-windows
      jobs:
      - name: clamav-windows
        release: clamav
        properties:
          clamav:
            database_mirror: <%= vars.example_ip_1 %>
      include:
        stemcell:
        - os: windows2012R2
        - os: windows2016
        - os: windows1803
    ```

4. To update the runtime config, run the following command:

    ```
    bosh2 -e BOSH-ENVIRONMENT update-runtime-config --name=clamav /tmp/clamav.yml
    ```

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">bosh2 -e my-env update-runtime-config --name=clamav /tmp/clamav.yml</pre> 

5. Navigate to the Installation Dashboard in Ops Manager
   and do the following to complete the installation:
