This topic describes how to add ClamAV to your Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) deployment.

## <a id="about-clamav"></a>About ClamAV Add-on for PCF

This add-on may be necessary for regulatory purposes if your compliance auditor
requires antivirus protection within the PCF environment.

For example, auditors sometimes expect that antivirus protection is present in an
environment that must comply with standards such as Payment Card Industry Data
Security Standard (PCI DSS) or Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
