## <a id="about-clamav"></a>About ClamAV Add-on for PCF

The ClamAV Add-on may be necessary for regulatory purposes if your compliance auditor requires antivirus protection within your PCF environment.

For example, auditors sometimes expect that antivirus protection is present in an
environment that must comply with standards such as Payment Card Industry Data
Security Standard (PCI DSS) or Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
