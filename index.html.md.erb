title: Installing the Pivotal Cloud Foundry ClamAV Add-on

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to add ClamAV to your Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) deployment.

This add-on may be necessary for regulatory purposes if your compliance auditor requires antivirus protection within the PCF environment. For example, auditors sometimes expect that antivirus protection be present in an environment that must comply with standards such as Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) or Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

##<a id="prereqs"></a>Prerequisites

To complete the ClamAV installation:

* You must be a PCF operator with admin rights. See the [Understanding Pivotal Cloud Foundry User Types](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/user-types.html#operator) topic for more information.

* You must have Ops Manager 1.7 or higher.

##<a id="create-mfest"></a>Create the ClamAV manifest

Follow the steps below to create the ClamAV manifest for your deployment:

1. Create a ClamAV runtime config portion of the manifest file named `clamav.yml`, using the following code as a template.
  <pre>releases:
  \- name: clamav 
    version: 1.0.0
  addons:
  \- name: clamav
      jobs:
      \- name: clamav
        release: clamav
      properties:
        clamav:
          database\_mirror:
            <%= vars.example_ip_1 %></pre>

2. Optionally, you can provide the hostname or IP address of a private ClamAV update mirror. 
Environments that cannot connect to the Internet normally use an update mirror. 
If you do not specify a value, ClamAV defaults to `db.local.clamav.net` for updates. 
See the [Private Local Mirrors](https://www.clamav.net/documents/private-local-mirrors) topic of the ClamAV documentation for instructions on how to set up a local mirror.

##<a id="download-deploy"></a>Download and Deploy the ClamAV Add-on  

1. Download the ClamAV add-on software binary from the [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-clamav-addon) to your local machine.
1. Copy the software binary to your Ops Manager virtual machine (VM).
  <pre class="terminal">$ scp -i PATH/TO/PRIVATE/KEY clamav-release.tar.gz ubuntu@YOUR-OPS-MANAGER-VM-IP:</pre>

1. Copy the ClamAV runtime manifest file to your Ops Manager instance.
  <pre class="terminal">$ scp -i PATH/TO/PRIVATE/KEY clamav.yml ubuntu@YOUR-OPS-MANAGER-VM-IP:</pre>

1. SSH into Ops Manager.
  <pre class="terminal">$ ssh -i PATH-TO-PRIVATE-KEY ubuntu@YOUR-OPS-MANAGER-VM-IP</pre>

1. On the Ops Manager VM, navigate to the software binary location.
  <pre class="terminal">$ cd PATH-TO-BINARY</pre>

1. On the Ops Manager VM, target your BOSH director instance.
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ bosh target YOUR-OPS-MANAGER-DIRECTOR-IP
  Target set to 'Ops Manager'
  Your username: director
  Enter password: ******************
  Logged in as 'director'
  </pre>

1. Upload your release.
  <pre class="terminal">$ bosh upload release PATH-TO-BINARY/BINARY-NAME.tar</pre>

1. From the command line, confirm that the upload of the ClamAV
software binary completed. You should see the ClamAV release.
  <pre class="terminal">$ bosh releases</pre>

1. Update your runtime configuration to include the ClamAV add-on.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you installed other BOSH add-ons, you must merge the ClamAV manifest into your existing add-on manifest. 
Append the contents of `clamav.yml` to your existing add-on `yml` file.</p>

    <pre class="terminal">$ bosh update runtime-config PATH/YOUR-ADD-ON-YML.yml</pre>

1. Verify your runtime configuration changes match what you specified in the
ClamAV runtime config.
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ bosh runtime-config
  Acting as user 'admin' on 'micro'
  releases:
  <span>-</span> name: clamav
      version: 1.0.0
  <br>
  addons:
    name: clamav
      jobs:
        <span>-</span> name: clamav
          release: clamav
  ...
  </pre>

1. Navigate to your Installation Dashboard in Ops Manager.

1. Click **Apply Changes**.

##<a id="alerts"></a> Configure Forwarding for ClamAV Alerts

The ClamAV BOSH release writes all alerts to the syslogs of the VMs in your deployment. You can use syslog forwarding to forward the alerts to a syslog aggregator.

* **Using the Elastic Runtime tile**: Follow the steps to [Configure System Logging](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/cloudform-er-config.html#sys-logging) in the Elastic Runtime tile. The syslog aggregator that you specify receives all alerts generated on Elastic Runtime VMs, including the ClamAV alerts.
* **Using the BOSH syslog release**: You can use the syslog BOSH release to forward system logs. See the [syslog-release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/syslog-release) for instructions.

## <a id="verify"></a>Verify your ClamAV Installation

1. [BOSH ssh](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#bosh-ssh) into one of the VMs in your deployment.

1. Run `monit summary`. Look for the following processes in the output:

    <pre class="terminal">The Monit daemon 5.2.4 uptime: 3d 0h 56m
    Process 'clamd'                     running
    Process 'freshclam'                 running</pre>

1. If `monit summary` does not list `freshclamd` and `clamd`, perform the following steps:
  1. Try to start the ClamAV processes by running the following commands:
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ monit start clamd
  $ monit start freshclam
  </pre>
  1. Run `monit summary` again. If you do not see the processes mentioned above, check `/var/vcap/sys/log/clamav` logs for errors.

1. If `monit summary` does list `freshclamd` and `clamd`, create a file on the VM with the following contents:

    ```
    X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*
    ```

    This is a virus signature used to test anti-virus software. 
    It may take up to an hour for ClamAV to locate the signature. 
    Check your syslog aggregator for the notification. 
    If the notification does not appear, check `/var/log/syslog` on the VM. 
    If virus notifications appear in the VM syslog but not in the aggregator, verify your syslog forwarding settings.
